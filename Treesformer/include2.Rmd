**Try applying each type of transformation and adjusting the scalar. Notice how the shape of the tree changes through branch length adjustments.**

 $\lambda$ is the most widely used and well known transformation. It works by multiplying all off-diagonal elements in the phylogenetic covariance matrix by a value (surprise! $\lambda$) which is restricted to values 0 $\ge$ $\lambda$ $\le$ 1 (*Notice that setting the value >1 creates meaningless tree structures*). This means it compresses or stretches internal branches while leaving terminal branches (tips) alone. $\lambda$ = 1 means the tree/ traits are evolving under a constant rate process--in this case Brownian motion. $\lambda$ = 0 means each species is statistically independent or none are more or less related to any other.
 
 $\delta$ transforms the tree to capture varying rates of evolution through time by raising each element in the matrix above the power $\delta$. Each element in the matrix represents a node in the tree so raising all nodes to $\delta = 1$ does nothing to the tree. If $\delta < 1$ each node is shortened, but internal nodes (not tips/extant species) are shortened less, representing a slowdown of evolutionary rates towards the present. Try setting $\delta$ to a value less than 1. Does this visually translate to a slowing evolutionary rate? Likewise, you can simulate a speed up of the evolutionary rate towards the present by setting $\delta > 1$.
 
 $\kappa$ is a weirder one and it can capture "speciational" dynamics in trees. It works by raising each branch length (not element in the matrix above) by the value $\kappa$. When $\kappa = 1$ the tree is unchanged. When $\kappa = 0$ all branch lengths are 1. $\kappa$ is interpreted as a model where rates of evolutionary change are fastest at speciation events.
