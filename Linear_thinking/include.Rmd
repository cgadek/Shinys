Linear regression is one of the foundational tools of statistical analyses and data science. With it, we can test for relationships in the world. Broadly it asks how do two things change in relation to one another using the standard form: $$y_i = a + \beta x_i$$

Where $y_i$ is something you are measuring, such as the length of a burrito or time spent studying. The $_i$ indicates a specific measurement among many. Next let's move on to $x$, which represents the thing you suspect has some affect or association or relationship with the thing you are measuring. For example, the number of ingredients in a burrito may affect it's length or the amount of sleep a student has gotten might affect thee time they spend studying. Again, the $_i$ subscript denotes a specific observation among many. So is one observation shows a burrito that is 20 cm long the corresponding $x_i$ value would be the number of ingredients in **that burrito**. 

$\beta$ represents the slope, or the amount the variable you are measuring ("response", "dependent", "outcome") changes with a one unit increase of $x$. A positive $\beta$ will result in a regression line pointing up and to the right in this instance. A negative $\beta$ will result in a line pointing down to the right. Try translating this to burrito length and ingredient count or amount of sleep and amount of time for studying. 

$a$ is a little slipperier as a concept. It indicates the intercept, meaning the value of $y$ when $x = 0$. The intercept—in a way—acts as a starting point for your model. But it can be meaningless in reality. For example a burrito with **zero** ingredients would not exist, by definition.

There is another important component here and that is some noise or error. If we measured each burrito without error and ingredients were invariant in size we would observe a perfect regression line, each data point exactly aligned. In the real world we see points fall on either side of the line, because measurement error is inescapable and individual variation is pervasive. *The world is messy. So, a more complete version of the regression formula includes an "error" term:
$$y_i = a + \beta x_i + \epsilon$$
